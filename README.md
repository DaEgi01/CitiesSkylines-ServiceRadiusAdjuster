# Service Radius Adjuster
Enables you to adjust the effect strength and radius of service buildings in your cities.

Ever wondered why your industry does not level up to level 3 before you put five Cargo Train Terminals in close proximity around it?
Ever wondered why you have to put down all service buildings every third block in order to keep your land value high?
Are you unhappy that if you game the system, you will get a very unrealistic city in result?

With this mod you can see and adjust the effect range of all service buildings just the way you want.
You can use this mod as a cheat to make this game even easier, use it to make it harder or try to make it as what you feel is realistic.
