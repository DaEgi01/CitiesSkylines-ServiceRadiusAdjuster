[h1]tl;dr description[/h1]
Enables you to adjust the effect radius of service buildings in your cities.

[h1]Long description[/h1]
Ever wondered why your industry does not level up to level 3 before you put five Cargo Train Terminals in close proximity around it?
Ever wondered why you have to put down all service buildings every third block in order to keep your land value high?
Are you unhappy that if you game the system, you will get a very unrealistic city in result?

With this mod you can see and adjust the effect range of all service buildings just the way you want.
You can use this mod as a cheat to make this game even easier, use it to make it harder or try to make it as what you feel is realistic.

[h1]What is new in v1.4.0?[/h1]
[list]
[*]Accumulation can also be edited.
[*]Custom buildings work now by default. No need to add them manually.
[*]Items your are not interested in can be ignored.
[*]Changed the UI somewhat.
[/list]

[h1]What?[/h1]
All ingame and custom healthcare, police, fire, education, public transport and cargo transport buildings, parks, unique buildings and monuments with such an effect, like the medical center can be tweaked.

[h1]How?[/h1]
After you enabled the mod ingame, there is an option page where you can adjust the values.
After you are done editing, press the "apply" or the "apply all" button and let time do the rest.

[h1]Effect[/h1]
The different effect strengths of the service buildings determine the land value. And land value is the biggest factor in order to determine the level of your buildings for residential and commercial zones.
For non specialized industry the building level is determined directly by service strength.
There is also the "Extended Building Information" mod, that makes the game mechanic visible.

If you increase the effect ranges, more land will be covered by your service buildings. The strength of the effect will increase, increasing your land value and your building levels in the process.
If you decrease the effect ranges, less land will be covered by your buildings. Your cims will potentially abandon the buildings due to a land value that is too low to support the level.
If you disable the mod, or reset the values to default, everything should be back to normal.

[h1]What not?[/h1]
This mod does not change AI behaviour.
So even if you change the range of clinic, it does not mean, that the ambulance will stay inside that radius.

[h1]How to add custom buildings[/h1]
Since version 1.4.0 it is not necessary to add custom buildings by hand.
You should find them in the menu in the appropriate group.

[h1]Caution![/h1]
With great power comes great pain. All values you change are reevaluated after a short period of time, so theoretically, you can play around with them without fear of really breaking your city. But since these values affect all default service buildings, the effect can be drastic. If you overdo it, you could be responsible for a mass exodus that could cripple your city for years to come.
No matter what values you chose, the simulation will balance out somewhere in the end. But maybe you won't like the result. And it could take some time.

Also the mod does not manage different values for your different cities yet. If you want to try it out in one city, disable the mod if you load another.

So be cautious, and always save first.

[h1]Code[/h1]
I will upload the code to github soon.

The code will be free as in every definition of free, so feel free to do with it whatever you want.
In case of bugs or feauture requests, please leave me a post on the issue tracker.
Forks and pull requests are welcome.

[h1]What's next for this mod[/h1]
Adjust effect strength - although it would invalidate the name of this mod xD
Different values for different savegames or profiles - maybe
A convenience function to easily add player made buildings to the configuration menu.
